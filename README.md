## JMeter 

The <a href="https://github.com/Evergaarden/apache_jmeter/blob/main/Performance_testing(Test_Plan).jmx">Performance_testing(Test_Plan).jmx</a> contains saved settings and variables that were used during testing.

Also I wrote a short <a href="https://github.com/Evergaarden/apache_jmeter/blob/main/JMeter_TestManual.md">manual</a> with detailed explanations about how and with which components and tools I tested in JMeter (the <a href="https://github.com/Evergaarden/apache_jmeter/blob/main/JMeter_Test_Plan_for_TestManual.jmx">file</a> which was used in the manual)
